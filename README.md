# DNA Alignment Methods

### Needleman-Wunsch Method - Global alingment

The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm performs global sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences

### Smith & Waterman Method - Local alingment

The Smithâ€“Waterman algorithm performs local sequence alignment; that is, for determining similar regions between two strings of nucleic acid sequences or protein sequences

> Additional Info

This algorithm was implemented during the Bio-informatics computation course @ UNESP-IBILCE, Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo, Brazil

### Compiling and running - C

gcc method.c -o method

Where:

- **gcc** is the compiler
- **<method>.c** is the file name
- **-o** refers to output
- **method** is the output bin

Feel free to use this code as you wish :)
